                The corner of West street and Chambers street was the busiest start station in June. 
                It had over 16,000 unique rides, almost 2,000 more than the second busiest start station. 
                The map demonstrates the number of unique rides and clearly shows where the busiest areas are.

                Based on the existing data, we calculated the duration of the trips. 
                The longest trips take place on Sunday and Saturday, averaging over 20 minutes, 
                while Wednesdays are the shortest when it comes to trip duration. 
                Surpringly though our analysis showed that most of the trips took place on Wednesdays and Thursdays. 
                This fenomenon only occured because in June we had 5 Wednesdays and Thursdays. 
                When we take this into consideration, the number of trips are quite similar.
